## UART Pin Identification

### Visual Inspection

| Label  | Description                              |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `TX`   | Transmit pin, used for sending data      |
| `RX`   | Receive pin, used for receiving data     |
| `GND`  | Ground pin, common electrical ground     |

**Procedure**: During the visual inspection, scan the hardware board for any of these markings or silkscreen labels to identify UART pins.


### Multimeter Probing

| Step   | Procedure                                         | Notes                                               |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Set the multimeter to DC voltage mode              | This allows you to measure direct current voltage   |
| 2      | Identify a ground point on the board               | You'll connect the black probe to this point        |
| 3      | Connect the black probe to the ground point        | Ground is often labeled as `GND`                    |
| 4      | Touch the red probe to a suspected pin             | Start with pins labeled `TX` or `RX` if possible    |
| 5      | Read the multimeter display                        | A `TX` pin may show a fluctuating voltage, `RX` will be quieter |
| 6      | Document the voltage reading                       | Useful for future reference                         |

**Procedure**: Use your multimeter in DC voltage mode to identify the potential `TX`, `RX`, and `GND` pins by measuring their voltage levels. Be cautious to avoid short-circuits.

#### Oscilloscope/Logic Analyzer
- **Procedure**: Use an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to monitor signals and identify UART pins. Observe signal patterns for TX and RX.

#### Automated Tools
- **Example**: Use tools like JTAGulator for automated UART pin identification.

#### Trial and Error
- **Procedure**: Use a UART-to-USB converter (e.g., FTDI or CP2102) and terminal software to test suspected pins. Experiment with different baud rates if necessary.

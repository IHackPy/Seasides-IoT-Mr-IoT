### Introduction to PCB
- Understanding of basic electronic components: traces, vias, pads, and layers.
- Familiarize yourself with the PCB layout software (e.g., Altium, Eagle).

### Tools Required
- **Multimeter**: For basic voltage, current, and resistance measurements.
- **Oscilloscope**: For time-domain signal analysis.
- **Logic Analyzer**: For digital signal capturing and protocol analysis.
- **X-ray Machine**: For inspecting multi-layer boards.
- **Soldering and De-soldering Stations**: For component manipulation.

### Circuit Tracing
- Identify primary components like microcontrollers (`MCU`), EEPROMs, flash memory, and connectors.
- Use schematic capture tools for mapping power (`VCC`), ground (`GND`), and data routes.

### Component Analysis
- Document component details (Part numbers, manufacturers).
- Research component datasheets for pin configurations and functionalities.
- Use automated test equipment (`ATE`) to test components where applicable.

### Connectivity Testing
- Employ a multimeter to test for electrical connectivity between traces and components.
- Identify buses and interfaces (SPI, I2C, UART, etc.).

### Signal Analysis
- Utilize oscilloscopes and logic analyzers to capture signal waveforms.
- Decode and interpret signal patterns using software tools like Saleae or Wireshark for digital protocols.

### Security Considerations
- Examine debug ports and test points for potential unauthorized access.
- Evaluate hardware for susceptibility to physical attacks (power glitching, fault injection, etc.).

### Reverse Engineering
- Derive a schematic diagram based on circuit tracing and component analysis.
- Use CAD software to sketch the reverse-engineered layout.

### Software Interaction
- Analyze embedded firmware to understand how the software layer interacts with hardware components.
- Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to dissect the compiled binaries.

### Documentation
- Compile all findings into a detailed technical report.
- Highlight potential vulnerabilities and propose mitigations.

### UART
- Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
- Pins: `GND`, `TX`, `RX`
- Typically used for terminal access, firmware updates, and diagnostics.

### JTAG
- Joint Test Action Group
- Pins: `TDI` (Test Data In), `TDO` (Test Data Out), `TMS` (Test Mode Select), `TCK` (Test Clock), `TRST` (Test Reset)
- Allows in-circuit debugging, and direct access to the memory and processor state.

### SWD
- Serial Wire Debug
- Pins: `SWDIO` (Data I/O), `SWCLK` (Clock)
- A simplified, two-pin alternative to JTAG.

### SPI
- Serial Peripheral Interface
- Pins: `MISO` (Master In, Slave Out), `MOSI` (Master Out, Slave In), `SCLK` (Serial Clock), `CS` (Chip Select)
- Commonly used for EEPROM, flash, and other serial-interface memory devices.

### I2C
- Inter-Integrated Circuit
- Pins: `SDA` (Serial Data), `SCL` (Serial Clock)
- Useful for low-speed, short-distance communication between ICs.

### Identifying Debug Ports
- Use PCB labeling, if available.
- Conduct circuit tracing and impedance measurements to identify potential debug ports.

### Security Measures
- Employ hardware fuses or disable debug functionalities in firmware to protect against unauthorized debugging.
- Lock down the debug ports using custom authentication schemes, if needed.

### Interacting with Debug Ports
- Utilize specialized hardware probes and software debuggers tailored for specific interfaces.
  
### Common Risks
- Unauthorized access leading to privilege escalation or confidential data leakage.
- Potential for code modification or device bricking.
